**TESTING**

The code has been validated using:

[W3C Mark-up Validation Service](http://https://validator.w3.org/ "W3C Mark-up Validation Service")

[W3C CSS Validation Service](http://https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "W3C CSS Validation Service")

[JSHint](https://jshint.com "JSHint")

This site has met the objective of creating online presence with minimalistic design and content, but providing enough information and platform to enable fast contact.

All links included on this website have target=_blank attribute added, which means they will open in a new tab. That permits users to simply get back where they were within my page. All links have been manually tested to make sure they are linked to correct destination.

The website has been tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, FireFox) and across different screen sizes (Galaxy C5, various iPhones, Huawei, iPad, iPad Pro and laptops) to make sure is responsive. Bootstrap and CCS Grid has been used to achieve this.

On bigger screens (min 992px and up) you will be able to see 

Sections have 4 columns, displayed next to each other, but on smaller screens it changes to 2 on top of 2.

All fonts, images and other attributes have been changed accordingly to fit different screen sizes. Media queries have been used to make them work.



**DEPLOYMENT**

The site was developed using PyCharm. Using version control in PyCharm I was able to commit and push to GitHub.

**Those steps were taking in order to deploy my page from GitHub repository:**

1. On Github navigate to [sneachda/memory-game-ms2](https://github.com/sneachda/memory-game-ms2 "sneachda/memory-game-ms2")
2.  From the menu at the top click on settings
3.  Scroll down to the GitHub pages section
4. Under Source section click on dropdown menu and select Master Branch as your GitHub pages publishing source.
5. Select save.

**To create a local repository please follow those steps:**

1. Go to [Github Project Repository](https://github.com/sneachda/memory-game-ms2 "Github Project Repository")
2. Under the repository name click Clone or download
3. In the 'Clone with HTTPs section' clone URL for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash in your local platform.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied earlier: git clone https://github.com/sneachda/memory-game-ms2.git
7. - After pressing ENTER your local clone will be created.
